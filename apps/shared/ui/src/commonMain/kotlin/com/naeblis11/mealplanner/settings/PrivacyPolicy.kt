/**
 * The privacy policy, shown in Settings and published as `docs/PRIVACY.md`.
 *
 * The two copies are kept word for word the same by `tests/test_privacy_policy.py`, so this is the one place to edit.
 *
 * Two rules the test also pins, because both are easy to undo by accident:
 *
 * - **It says what happens, never how.** No folders, ports, protocols, hosts, libraries or the name of whatever
 *   service hosts a release. A privacy policy has to tell the reader which third parties see anything and what
 *   leaves the device; it does not have to hand anyone a map of the build. Vague about the plumbing, exact about
 *   the data.
 * - **Nothing personal.** No names, accounts, handles, addresses or machine names. The only contact is the site.
