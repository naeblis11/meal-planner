/**
 * LAN sync stage 1: SQLite triggers record the last change to every synced record in sync_change (SyncChangeEntity),
 * so no write path (a repository, RecipeFolder, a raw DAO call) can forget to, and an entity @Update can't overwrite
 * a stamp. [Callback] installs them, with this device's id and change counter in app_meta, each time the database
 * opens; recreating them every time keeps them in step with this code. A change only counts when one of the table's
 * synced columns really changed, so the desktop's file bookkeeping (file_name, file_hash) is never a change. A change
 * of a record's key (a renamed pantry item, a meal moved to another slot) is a delete of the old key and a change of
 * the new one. REPLACE (a meal put into a filled slot) fires no delete trigger, as SQLite fires them only with
 * recursive_triggers on, so the slot stays live. Pantry and aisle keys are the name folded to lower case in ASCII only
 * ([nameKey], [asciiLower]), never through SQLite's lower(), whose folding a phone's platform SQLite may widen.
