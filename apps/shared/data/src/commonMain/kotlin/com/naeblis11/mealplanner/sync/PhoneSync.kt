 * - **Pairing** (D3): a scanned code tries each of its addresses pinned; a typed code pairs unpinned with a PC [finder]
 *   found. Either way the pairing is stored ([store]), the household id goes into app_meta, and the marks are cleared.
 * - **Sync** (D2, D6): only with a stored pairing, always pinned to its fingerprint. The PC is tried at the stored
 *   address, then at each PC mDNS finds in [FIND_MILLIS] (the stored name first). A host that answers with another
 *   certificate is passed over. A new address that works is stored first. Nowhere: SyncHttp.UNREACHABLE.
 * - **Removed on the PC:** UnpairedException forgets the pairing and the marks, keeps the data, and is thrown on.
 * - **Leave** (D3): tells the PC at the stored address (best effort), then forgets as above.
 *
 * There is exactly one PhoneSync per process, held app-scoped with its one [PhoneSyncControls]: the lock only
 * serializes work within one instance, so a second one would race the first over the pairing and the marks.
 *
 * **A client PC** (stage 4a) is the same client with [kind] PairingWire.KIND_PC: the PC lists it as a PC. [onJoined]
 * runs after a pairing is kept (the household id already taken), and [onLeft] after a Leave or a removal has forgotten
 * it; on a PC they change its role (and give a PC that left a household of its own). Both run under the lock, and a
 * failure in either is thrown on: the pairing (or its forgetting) has already been kept.
