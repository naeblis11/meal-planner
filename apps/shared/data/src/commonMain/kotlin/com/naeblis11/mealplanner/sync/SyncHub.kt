 * back, except the client's own. A cursor the hub never gave answers with everything, and everything includes the
 * client's own records. A cursor is the hub's only with the hub's id ([HUB_ID_KEY]): a rebuilt or replaced hub has a

 * 2b's routes call this after checking the device key; [requester] is the paired device's id.
